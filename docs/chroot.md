# chroot

You can also use `uniget` to install under an arbitrary directory. This is useful for creating chroot environments.

Specifying `--prefix` will install the tools under the given directory:

- `PREFIX/usr/local` for tools
- `PREFIX/var/lib/uniget` for state
- `PREFIX/var/cache/uniget` for cached data
